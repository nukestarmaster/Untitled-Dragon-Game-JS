Spell system:
Spells can be toggled like actions but can be leveled up like skills
Any number of spells may be toggled on at the same time, if you can pay for them.
Spells have upkeep (usually mana), yield (usually just exp), benefits and drawbacks (usually reducing spell effeciency)
Spells mods are effeciency, yield, spellpower (increases benefits, parent of yield mod), resilience (reduces drawbacks) and bonus levels
Some benefits scale at less than linear with spellpower
Base upkeep, yield, benefits and drawbacks scale linearly with level (yield slightly faster than upkeep, benefits slightly faster than drawbacks)
Efficiency, yield, spellpower and resilience scale slightly with level
Five primary kinds of spells:
	- Buff spells (give bonus while active, like a haste spell increasing action speed)
	- Channelling spells (spend another resource to generate mana)
	- Production spells (spends mana to generate resources)
	- Restoration spells (spends mana to restore vitals)
	- Combat spells (spend mana to use special combat actions)

New action meditate (stamina + satiety => mana, skill mana manipulation)

New limit action (book) spellbook (gives exp in magical skills/attributes, teaches a new spell with every completion)
