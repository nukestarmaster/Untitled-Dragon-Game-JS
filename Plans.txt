Spell system:
Spells can be toggled like actions but can be leveled up like skills
Any number of spells may be toggled on at the same time, if you can pay for them.
Spells have upkeep (usually mana), yield (usually just exp), benefits and drawbacks (usually reducing spell effeciency)
Spells mods are effeciency, yield, spellpower (increases benefits, parent of yield mod), resilience (reduces drawbacks) and bonus levels
Some benefits scale at less than linear with spellpower
Base upkeep, yield, benefits and drawbacks scale linearly with level (yield slightly faster than upkeep, benefits slightly faster than drawbacks)
Efficiency, yield, spellpower and resilience scale slightly with level
Three primary kinds of spells:
	- Buff spells (give bonus while active, like a haste spell increasing action speed)
	- Channelling spells (spend another resource to generate mana)
	- Production/restoration spells (spends mana to generate resources/vitals)

New vital mana (spent to cast spells and to do some magical actions)
New action meditate (stamina + satiety => mana, skill mana manipulation)
New limit action (book) spellbook (gives exp in magical skills/attributes, teaches a new spell with every completion)
New skill mana manipulation (increases spell effeciency, increases max mana)
New skill spellcraft (bonus levels to all spells)
New attribute willpower (increases spell resilience)
New attribute power (increases spell spellpower)
